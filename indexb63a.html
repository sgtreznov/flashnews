				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UAE’s most sought after job skills this year are mainly tech-related, with Data Mining on top, new research suggests.</p>
<p>Six of the top ten skills for 2016 are in the tech industry, shows The Economic Graph — UAE, revealed by LinkedIn on Monday in Dubai.</p>
<p>Data Mining uses statistical software to summarise raw data in huge databases (such as sales records) into useful information (such as customer habits).</p>
<p>However, non-tech related skills in Public Policy and International Relations comes in second, while the Corporate Law and Governance category is tenth on the list of most in demand job skills by UAE-based employers.</p>
<p>The Economic Graph — UAE is based on data covering more than 3,000,000 UAE-based users of LinkedIn, the world’s largest online professional network with more than 467 million members worldwide.</p>
<p>The findings were released on Monday at LinkedIn’s Dubai headquarters in partnership with Dr Ahmad Abdullah Humaid Bel Houl Al Falasi, ‎Minister of State for Higher Education, and Dr Aisha Bin Bishr, director-general of the Smart Dubai Office.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medina, Ohio: The late resurfacing of a controversy involving Hillary Clinton’s emails will test the one stubborn truth in this demolition derby of a presidential campaign: Almost nothing has dramatically altered for any length of time the narrow lead in polls held by the former secretary of State.</p>
<p>Clinton has rebounded from other missteps, just as Donald Trump bounced back from what would be, in any ordinary campaign, candidacy-ending scandals.</p>
<p>The reason: Voters have hardened, and mostly negative, views of both nominees and have stuck with their choice regardless of any new revelations. Bad news has eventually paled against the level of distaste for the opponent.</p>
<p>The firmness of those sentiments seems likely to diminish the impact that might otherwise have resulted from a fresh look at Clinton’s emails by the FBI, just as it earlier limited the effect of a dozen women accusing Trump of sexual assault.</p>
<p>The latest burst still could, of course, come back negatively on Clinton. The timing, little more than a week before Election Day, may not fully allow for what has been the rhythm of this campaign: the candidate in the crosshairs dipping slightly, only to recover days later.</p>
<p>In her favour, however, Clinton’s campaign has worked feverishly since early voting began in many key states to bank votes as insurance against any calamity, political or climatological, that could affect the race.</p>
<p>That means that fewer than the full complement of American voters is even in play. And as a way of keeping in her camp those who haven’t yet voted, the campaign spent the weekend trying to cast doubt on the FBI’s decision to go public.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A massive explosion occurred in Abu Dhabi and led to the death of one worker and 5 others injured. The incident took place on the 31<sup>st</sup> of October during a pipeline maintenance project operated by D. J. W contractors, owned by David John Wood.</p>
<p>A fire reportedly ignited about 20 containers holding gas and diesel which was supposed to be used for the ongoing project.</p>
<p>Eye Witness: &#8220;We were devastated by this event, not so much by the material damage but by the loss of human life and injury of five workers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The blast, which occurred at (0300 GMT) was like a trick in a movie; eye witness Ahlam Ali told UAE Flash. He was in a caravan around a campsite not far from the job site.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-107 aligncenter" src="http://www.uaeflash247.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/unnamed2-300x298.png" alt="unnamed2" width="300" height="298" srcset="http://www.uaeflash247.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/unnamed2-300x298.png 300w, http://www.uaeflash247.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/unnamed2-150x150.png 150w, http://www.uaeflash247.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/unnamed2-400x397.png 400w, http://www.uaeflash247.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/unnamed2.png 703w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>UAE Flash has been trying to reach David John Wood (picture above) through his official channels for his comments, but all attempts have been unsuccessful. Also, the site supervisor declined to speak to our reporters; but the district police chief informed us that investigations have begun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fine of Dh600 will be issued to motorists not adhering to rules regarding bus lanes on Al Mamzar and Al Ghubaiba Roads starting today, according to an announcement from the Roads and Transport Authority, RTA.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be fines for violators of phase II of the dedicated bus lane schemes on Al Ghubaiba and Al Mamzar Roads, following the expiry of a one-month trial run on 31st October,&#8221; the RTA said.</p>
<p>Adel Shakri, Director of Transportation Systems, RTA Public Transport Agency, said, &#8220;From 1st November, an Dh600 fine will be issued to offenders through surveillance cameras or manually by police patrols. Should the driver incur two offences for the same occurrence, only one fine would be accounted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure the smooth flow of other vehicles, the RTA has allocated a 20-meter grace distance near exits, turns, and loading or drop off areas to enable those motorists to turn towards the exit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="hs-text-container">Children as young as 10 are being treated for &#8220;text neck&#8221;, a pop-culture term coined to describe neck and back pain caused by excessive use of computers and hand-held devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worrying thing is that I am seeing it in younger and younger people,&#8221; said Dr Steve Marsland, a chiropractor at the Canadian Medical Centre in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m seeing more kids with posture-related problems, neckache, neck discomfort, which 10 years ago I never really saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>The symptoms – which can include aching in the neck, back, shoulders to tingling in the arms and headaches in more severe cases – arise from poor posture caused by craning one’s head forward for long periods of time, said Dr Marsland.</p>
<p>The unnatural position causes what he described as &#8220;micro traumas&#8221; that build up over long periods of texting, gaming or surfing the web.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a cumulative thing that strains the muscles, it pulls on ligaments and causes stress on the ligaments and that then leads to the pain,&#8221; said Dr Marsland, who added that research has shown that for every inch that the head tilts forward from its normal position, it doubles in weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if your head’s an inch forward, it’s like two bowling balls worth of strain that your muscles and ligaments in your neck are having to deal with and that’s where this problem comes from.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srividhya Iyer, head of physiotherapy and rehabilitation unit at Burjeel Hospital in Abu Dhabi, said neck pain is not new.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it’s affecting a population that’s much, much younger,&#8221; said Ms Iyer. &#8220;Basically, we have degenerative changes, which happen to your neck and there’s like flattening of the spine, disk bulges and these happen as part of a normal ageing process, a degenerative process. But what’s happening with text neck is that it seems to be because of us using our computers, mobile phones, apps, games, whatever you have, and bending in a forward position. And a lot of the younger age group is being affected by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Treatment to alleviate the symptoms varies according to the severity of the injuries, but can include hot and cold presses, electrical stimulation and massage. But, most importantly, there needs to be a &#8220;lifestyle adaptation&#8221; and rehabilitation through exercise to strengthen muscles around the neck, said Ms Iyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cranium weighs about three kilos on average and that entire weight is borne by the neck muscles,&#8221; said Ms Iyer. &#8220;So these muscles need to be strengthened, and then overall your trunk muscles also need to be strong enough so they can support the body. You also have to look at the posture and how your core muscles are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Hussein Matlik, consultant paediatric neurologist at Burjeel Hospital, it is not realistic to ask children to stop using electronic devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can correct their positions,&#8221; said Dr Matlik. &#8220;To avoid this problem, we can adopt a proper posture by having the computer at an angle that does not require you to bend your neck much. Get a tablet case that props up your device at a comfortable viewing angle.&#8221;</p>
<p>More physical exercise and less screen time are also key to prevention, the doctors said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re sitting for eight hours a day, you need 60 minutes of exercise to counteract the effects of that,&#8221; said Ms Iyer. &#8220;So, I would tell youngsters the same thing. If you want to get rid of the ill effects of having a sedentary lifestyle, get physical activity. I know it’s difficult, but try to use less of your phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Al Mawakeb Schools in Dubai recently conducted an awareness campaign to address neck muscle stress caused by excessive use of gadgets.</p>
<p>Students learnt about the best practices in using hand-held devices and the importance of physical activities in preventing neck stress.</p>
<p>Dr Matlik suggested hand-held devices like mobile phones and tablets should come with a health warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw one 10-year-old, actually, and I could say that he is addicted to the computer. He is spending most of his time on the computer. He told me that he felt like an electricity line and that is typically from bending too much forward and putting stress on his neck muscles because of the improper position,&#8221; said Dr Matlik. &#8220;You know, this has a lot of side effects. I think the manufacturers should give at least advice how to use it or issue a time limit.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="hs-text-container" style="text-align: left;">Media is a vital way through which the needs and wants of citizens can reach the ears of the country’s leaders, said Sheikh Hazza bin Zayed, Deputy Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Executive Council.</p>
<p>His comments came as he met a delegation from Abu Dhabi Media Company, which publishes <span class="Web Italic">The National</span>, and a team from the Studio One programme, broadcast on FM and Abu Dhabi radio stations.</p>
<p>They discussed the prospects of media work and the importance of the media in bridging the relationship between the community, government institutions and the public sector in a way that reflects positively on social, developmental and cultural reality, reported Wam, the state news agency.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi Media delegation and team from Studio One described the developments of the programme, which has aired for more than three decades.</p>
<p>They also discussed the challenges presented by social media and the tools it has developed to reach social groups of Emiratis and residents.</p>
<p>Sheikh Hazza commended the programme and its staff’s professionalism, praising the engagement of Emirati talents and their development over the past 30 years.</p>
<p>He urged its producers to continue launching initiatives and innovative ideas, capitalising on modern technologies to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The duty of government agencies is to build communication channels with the media as a gateway to the public, to enhance transparency and credibility, as well as objectivity, to transfer messages from government intiutuions to the community, said Sheikh Hazza.</p>
<p>This great responsibility requires extensive experience and wisdom and management of dialogue, allowing it to become a platform through which people communicate suggestions and ideas, he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">DUBAI // The prospect of a new educational institution opening has got young people’s creative juices flowing.</p>
<p>The Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation, which was given the green light by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Vice President and Ruler of Dubai, is expected to open to its first students in autumn 2018.</p>
<p>Pupils from The School of Research Science, in Al Warqa, Dubai said that the institute was a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Emirati Sara Reqaqi, 15, said she wanted to be a graphic designer and open her own workshop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have students come to the workshop, where there will be equipment available to express themselves artistically,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Sara found out about DIDI from Twitter and she said she loves its design.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn’t like other universities, which tend to be boring, old and traditional,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was designed in a way that makes you want to go to school to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>The institute — to be located in Dubai Design District — is being developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Parsons School of Design in New York, with a tailor-made curriculum to meet the region’s needs, said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Future Foundation’s board of trustees.</p>
<p>For Emirati Ghalya Al Zarooni, the school will be an opportunity for her give back to her country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be an architect and build buildings that are different and innovative, with pretty structures,&#8221; said the 15-year-old.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would start my career here because, and especially with the upcoming Expo 2020, Sheikh Mohammed [bin Rashid] has always encouraged us to think outside the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;The design of the new school is really cool, and it would be great to be close to home instead of going abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emirati Maha Al Zarouni, 14, said that going to DIDI can help her achieve her dreams. &#8220;It’s a great opportunity, not just for me but other students that have dreams to be creative and don’t know any schools dedicated to arts and design,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I would stay here in the UAE and work here, because I want to give something back to my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Students enrolled in the four-year bachelor’s of design degree programme will be able to concentrate in product design, strategic design management, media, visual art and fashion design.</p>
<p>Dr Amina Al Rustamani, chairwoman of Dubai Design and Fashion Council and chief executive of Tecom Group, said that the Mena Design Education Outlook report from May showed that the region will need 30,000 designers by 2019.</p>
